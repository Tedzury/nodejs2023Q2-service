## Prerequisites

Hello, Reviewer! Here is detailed instructions on how to start project and run test!

NB! Few words about task item "+20 OpenAPI spec in doc folder corresponds with assignment". I not sure what is true meaning of this point. So, I just wrote schema of my app, generated by swagger, into that file. According to logic, if my task implementation is passing the tests, it corresponds with assignment. Sorry, if we have different points of views.

## Downloading

```
git clone {repository URL}
```

## Installing NPM modules

```
npm install
```

## Make .env file

Make your own .env file and copy content of .env.example into it, or just copy .env.example and rename it into .env.

## Running application

```
npm start
```

After starting the app on port (4000 as default) you can open
in your browser OpenAPI documentation by typing http://localhost:4000/doc/.
For more information about OpenAPI/Swagger please visit https://swagger.io/.

## Run test command

```
npm run test
```

Run this command into CLI and see 67 test cases completed. Here is it, that simple :)

## Testing

After application running open new terminal and enter:

To run all tests without authorization

```
npm run test
```

To run only one of all test suites

```
npm run test -- <path to suite>
```

To run all test with authorization

```
npm run test:auth
```

To run only specific test suite with authorization

```
npm run test:auth -- <path to suite>
```
